    <h1>Creative Intervention</h1>

    <p>
      This is a small, careful video project about how art — music, film, books, games, or other creative work — can act as genuine support during difficult periods in life.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m interested in thoughtful conversation, not spectacle. This project is not therapy, not promotion, and not about reliving the worst moments of anyone’s life.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a piece of art mattered to you — helped you stay grounded, gave you energy, or helped you get through a hard stretch — and you might be open to talking about that experience, you’re welcome to reach out.
    </p>

      <strong>Contact:</strong><br />

    <h2>What reaching out does (and doesn’t) mean</h2>

    <p>
      Reaching out does <strong>not</strong> commit you to appearing on camera or sharing anything you’re not comfortable with. It simply opens a conversation.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we talk, we’ll do so privately first. You can pause, stop, or decline at any point.
    </p>

    <p>
      If now isn’t the right time for you, that’s completely okay.
    </p>
    <p><h2></h2>Who Am I?</h2></h2></p>
    <p>
My name is Miguel Rodriguez. I’m a longtime interviewer, educator, and creative professional with nearly fifteen years of experience helping people feel safe and comfortable in deep, reflective conversations.
</p>


<p>
This project grows out of both professional work and personal experience — including my own understanding of how art can function as real support during periods of emotional difficulty.

        This project approaches mental health with care and respect. It does not replace professional support.
